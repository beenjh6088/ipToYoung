10.04	Pokemon Bread / 포켓몬 빵
	textbook
		i'm a ordinary mom with a son in forth grade
		about 2 months ago i happend to buy 2 pokemon pastry 
		while i was shopping for groceries
		i gave them to my son and he was over the moon, seeing how happy it made him
		i started to hunt around for the breads
		at first, i stood in  line at the super market before they open to buy the pastry
		but explosive popularity of pokemon bread meant that a line grew longer and longer
		now i have to leave the house 
		even before my son goes to school to get my hands on the bread	 
		sometimes weekend morning, the whole family lined up to buy the breads
		it started out as a bit of fun 
		but now i worried of it that has become an obsession
		my husband is strongly against it, seeing how it has taken up my weekend
		so we decided that this week would be the last
		but i wonder why i still want to sneak out!
